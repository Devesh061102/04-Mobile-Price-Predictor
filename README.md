## Roadmap

**Objective**: The main objective of the Car Price Range Predictor is to accurately classify cars into price ranges based on their features. This tool can help potential car buyers and sellers to better understand the market value of cars.

**Data Collection**: The dataset used in this project contains various features of cars such as engine size, horsepower, and other specifications.

**Feature Engineering**: Relevant features are selected and preprocessed to be used in the machine learning models.

**Modeling**: The project uses multiple machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Random Forests to classify the cars into different price ranges.

**Evaluation**: The models are evaluated based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A confusion matrix and ROC curves are also used for evaluation.

**User Interface**: The project has a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, where users can input car features and get the predicted price range. It also provides various visualizations to help users understand the model's performance.
